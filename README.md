# solar_power_prediction
Intership project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a predictive analysis of solar power generation using a Linear Regression algorithm. The notebook is designed to showcase data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a machine learning model to predict solar power output.

Project Overview

Harnessing solar energy efficiently requires accurate predictions of power generation. This project provides a practical implementation of a machine learning pipeline to forecast solar power based on historical data and environmental factors.
